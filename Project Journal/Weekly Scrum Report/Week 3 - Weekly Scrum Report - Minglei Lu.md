# Weekly Scrum Report

##Stand-up Questions

- What tasks did I work on / complete?

I redesigned the ball class as observer and so that the UI image of the ball will change as the score reaches certain point. After that I focused on the main world class modification. Instead of a very simple main menu, we decided to add buttons for redirection to other worlds. 

In the first design, I added a "start" button to activate the stage game to start. I also added a "load" button waiting for the save/load functionality to be added. 

What's more, I also added a "score" and "about" button for future uses which are supposed to redirect users to score board and the Ad video respectively.


- What am I planning to work on next?

Seperating Stage Game world and the main menu world. Since the Greenfoot project puts every actor class objects into the same world and it would be very crowded since in our project we have much more actor objects than usual. We decided to seperate those two worlds to make logic and code clean and also to reuse some of the codes. It's a good refactoring design.

- What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

N/A

##XP Core Values

- Communication

This is the busiest week of our project. We discussed a lot about problems each team members have and we also discussed about the implementation details for some of the classes. Sometimes we have an agreement and sometimes we don't, but after profound communication, it's easier for us to understand each other's need and implement our own use cases more efficiently.

- Simplicity


- Feedback


- Courage


- Respect
