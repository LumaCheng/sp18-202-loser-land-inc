In this week, our team discuss about the whole direction and architecture about our project.
We decide the type of our game, and the details of all feature that we’ll implement in the next few weeks.
We divide implementation into several parts, and my main job are implementing the score board and background music player.
I started to design the structure of a class for High Score Board class and the other for Music Player.

I will design the structure of scoreboard and use one of the design pattern to implement it.
Also, I will figure out how to use Greenfoot and plan to design all the classes that I have to implement.
