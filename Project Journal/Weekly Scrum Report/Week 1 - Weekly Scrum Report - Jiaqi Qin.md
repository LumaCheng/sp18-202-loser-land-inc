## XP Core Values

- Communication
I feel like the communication this team is great, since everyone participated in the discussion session and had fun. We brainstormed on what new features that we can add to such a classic game. In the end, our ideas became clearer and clearer. It was a lot of fun and we were all passionate on what we were going to achieve. Free atomsphere and comprehensive communication make me confident on the following weeks that we can definitely make something interesting.
