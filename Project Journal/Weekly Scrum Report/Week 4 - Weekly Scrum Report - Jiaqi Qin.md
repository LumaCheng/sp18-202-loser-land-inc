## XP Core Values

- Feedback
In the last stage of integration, we got many feedbacks. All those feedbacks helped us to understand how each components works and how to avoid causing problems when integrating with other modules.

It is critical that we learned more feedback could be collected during development and help to promote the quality of design and coding.
