##Stand-up Questions

- What tasks did I work on / complete?

This week, I enabled the functionality of pause during the stage game. After clicking the pause button, a new screen will show up with three buttons: "resume", "save", "exit". Up to now, our game is able to save current state and load the stage if the player desired it. The resume button will take the player back to before he/she clicked the pause button. Save button will save the whole stage information including everything needed to recreate the exact same stage to the player. Exit button will take the user back to the main menu without saving anything.

- What am I planning to work on next?

Since the implementation of buttons are not command design button now, it's kind of difficult to recreate more buttons with the API of the command class. I decide to refactor the whole button design to command design pattern for other team members to use.

- What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

##XP Core Values

- Communication


- Simplicity


- Feedback


- Courage


- Respect

Members of my team are all very respectful. We discuss implementation everyday. And even if we don't have an agreement in some discussions, we still repect each other and decide to continue with a certain design idea. If it works, we will continue with it, and if it doesn't work, we will try the idea of the members with the opposite ideas.
