## XP Core Values

- Courage

This week we faced some technical problems. But the whole team was patient and worked together to discuss problems and propose solutions. Everyone in this team showed their responsibilities and the faith to solve any issue encountered, no matter who was the one to cause the problem. No blame, just get things done.
