##Stand-up Questions

- What tasks did I work on / complete?

Since one of my use case is about the UI for the game. What I did this week is that I read the code in details and fogure out which part of the code is in charge of assign a png file to the ball object in the game. After that I searched online and brainstormed looking for good pictures to assign to our ball object in the game. After that I decided to design the ball as an observer to observe score so the ball UI image will change when score reaches a certain level.

- What am I planning to work on next?

Next week I decide to refactor ball class as observer and also I need to start redesign the world class.

- What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
