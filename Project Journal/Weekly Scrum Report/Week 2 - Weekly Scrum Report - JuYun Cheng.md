## Stand-up Questions

- What tasks did I work on / complete?

In this week, I decide to use state pattern to implement music player,
And I choose observer pattern to implement the update information both in music player and high score board.
Music player tracks the volume each time when it changes.
High score board tracks the score each time when the score increases.

- What am I planning to work on next?

I will start to implement music player and integrate observer pattern in it.
Gamer can play or stop the background music and they can also change the volume of music.
So, I need to implement the feature that can turn down or up the volume.

- What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?

Nope. Each team members works on their own tasks, like designing and implementing classes and design patterns.

## XP Core Values

- Communication

Our team member worked together and tried to figure out what kinds of design patterns we can implement in our project.
After a effective communication, everyone had their own tasks which corresponds to one or more design patterns.
